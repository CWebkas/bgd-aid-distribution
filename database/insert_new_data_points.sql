------------- backend queries for entering new amenities into the dataset: 
--------1. insert into db: 
insert into geo_reach_infra (fid, class, type, contamination_risk_score, geom)
values row (select max(fid)+1, {1}, {2}, {3}, st_setsrid(st_point({4}, {5}), 4326)
            from geo_reach_infra)

--fid automatisch erstellen als max(fid)+1
--1: class muss angegeben werden
--2: type bei 
    --health_service ('Community Clinic', 'DTC', 'Diagnostic point', 'Health Post Fixed', 'Health Post Mobil', 'Hospital', 'Other specialised services', 'PHC', 'SRH clinic') 
    --sanitation ('latrine', 'bathing')
--3: contamination_risk_score bei 
    --tubewells ('very high', 'high', 'intermediate', 'low')
--4: longitude
--5: latitude
