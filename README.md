# GIS for humanitarian aid
### A seminar project
The emergence of the world's largest refugee camp with around 750,000 people since 2017 has led to massive humanitarian needs in the Region of Cox Bazar, Bangladesh. Ranging from the lack of water and nutritional infrastructure to coping with severe trauma up to granting physical security to female camp inhabitants, the entire situation in the camps has been precarious from the start \cite{unhcr}. Since the beginning of this crisis, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and its partners are constantly aiming to respond to these needs. Nonetheless, such an unparalleled humanitarian crisis of this dynamic and magnitude requires efficient information management to target needs on the ground and keep all stakeholders within this UNHCR mission informed continuously. Therefore, the central problem of our project is the highly volatile environment in the refugee camps in Cox Bazar. Many individuals and NGOs are working on different projects within a broad pattern of subjects within the UNHCR framework. Their coordination will be significantly facilitated by digital assistance.\\

Therefore, by means of a web application, we have developed a geographic information system to efficiently present the current situation of the refugee camps in Cox Bazar. The following four points reflect the central goals of the app:

- Global and always up-to-date representation of the humanitarian situation in Cox Bazar
- Identification of local vulnerabilities and humanitarian needs
- Identification of potential impacts arising from new humanitarian facilities. 
- Monitoring of latest humanitarian developments and improvements

With these objectives, the web app serves as an assistance tool for operational managers, PR personnel, as well as for on-site teams. This broad group of actors is efficiently connected by our system, as locally customizable information is immediately incorporated into a globally structured presentation at all administrative levels. This dynamically adaptable structure allows for a more efficient allocation of aid resources to those affected on-site, which can ultimately make a significant contribution to mitigating human suffering in the region of Cox-Bazar.
